JavaFX community has created the following plugins for Maven and Gradle to help create and maintain a JavaFX application:

* [JavaFX Maven Plugin](https://github.com/openjfx/javafx-maven-plugin/)
* [JavaFX Gradle Plugin](https://github.com/openjfx/javafx-gradle-plugin/)

These plugins are designed to make JavaFX fun by taking away all the boilerplate and wiring, required to run a JavaFX application.
There is no need to download the JavaFX SDK or add the JavaFX modules to the module-path.

This section will be a brief introduction to these plugins.
