# Getting Started with JavaFX

JavaFX allows you to create Java applications with a modern, hardware-accelerated user interface that is highly portable.

{{% notice note %}}
This is a short tutorial on how to write a JavaFX application using JDK 11 and later.
For a more in-depth knowledge on JavaFX and its components please check the [reference documentation for JavaFX](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javase-clienttechnologies.htm).

JavaFX builds on top of JDK and is a standalone component. There are 2 different options for developing JavaFX applications:

* Use the [JavaFX SDK / JavaFX JMods](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/)
* Use a build system (e.g. Maven/Gradle)

For both options, it is required to have a recent version of JDK, or at least JDK 11.
