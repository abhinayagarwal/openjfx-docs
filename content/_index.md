# Getting Started with JavaFX

JavaFX allows you to create Java applications with a modern, hardware-accelerated user interface that is highly portable.

{{% notice note %}}
This is a short tutorial on how to write a JavaFX application using JDK 11 and later.
In case you are new to JavaFX, we recommend going through [JavaFX reference documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javase-clienttechnologies.htm)
It contains detailed information on JavaFX architecture, layouts, controls, style sheets, FXML, and visual effects.

A JavaFX application will build on top of JDK. There are 2 different options for developing JavaFX applications:

* Use the [JavaFX SDK / JavaFX JMods](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/)
* Use a build system (e.g. Maven/Gradle)

For both options, it is required to have a recent version of JDK, or at least JDK 11. More information is available about it in the next section.
